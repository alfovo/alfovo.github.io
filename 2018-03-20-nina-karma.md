## The Design Challenge
Having found customers mostly by word of mouth, Nina wanted more visibility for her business. However, being in the relatively new life coaching space, she had some difficulty communicating the value proposition of her services to new customers.

Nina also wanted a quick and easy way for customers to see her availability and make appointments. She had been managing all her appointments through phone or text conversations, which was making it difficult to scale her business.

## Research
I began my research with the question:

## Workflow

From pen and paper, to visual comps in Figma, to high fidelity mockups using Principle, the design process continued for several iterations. I used [Ryan Singer's shorthand](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) for my user flow, which I highly recommend as it's fast to sketch and simple to understand.

## Branding

After conducting my research, I spent the first two weeks iterating with Nina on logo design and branding. We wanted her customers to feel confident, comfortable and empowered to tackle whatever challenges inspired them to seek life coaching. Also, we wanted lighthearted brand imagery to differentiate my client from the stock photos of tree lined parkways, scribbled notebooks and meditating women featured on her competitors' websites. 

A bright color palette, custom svg illustrations and simple typography highlight my client's warm and empathetic approach to life coaching.

## Prototype

After settling on a brand-mark and icon set, I created a prototype for single page microsite that highlighted Nina's service offerings, testimonials and an included an easy scheduling interface.

## Conclusion
To help a life coach in Washington D.C. expand her business to new customers, I used in-depth interviews and surveys to better understand her customer base and their interactions with the interface. I found that the majority of people are interested in trying a life coach, but convenience is key for keeping them engaged. 

I would like to expand on these findings by following up with her customers who are most frequently using the her website to schedule appointments in a few months.
