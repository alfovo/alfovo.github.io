I made invitations for my mom's birthday this weekend! The design for the pattern came from a phone conversation with her where I tried to get her to list things that she liked without making her suspicious. I also made magnets from the invitation as party favors and a [yacht rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/073y7oIhU3cuP3UAEH6fGP) playlist for the dinner. She loved the magnets but was disturbed by the playlist.
