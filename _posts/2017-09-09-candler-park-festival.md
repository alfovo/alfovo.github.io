Camelot Collective participated in our third festival, the [Candler Park Fall Fest](https://fallfest.candlerpark.org/). This time we did not break even, the sun beat down on our booth and my eyes felt a little unfocused from all the card folding I had completed late into the night before. I thought to myself that artists at these festivals must make unobjectionable and predictable work because the booth fees are so high.

I was suddenly disgusted by my "cheerful portraits inspired by the plants, animals and history around us." I was neither cheerful nor inspired at the Candler Park Fall Festival. I had hoped people would laugh at the faces and postures of the dogs I painted, instead they seemed annoyed that I didn't have a wider selection of dog breeds. I began to feel ashamed of my portraits of women activists. If I wanted to draw attention to the history of activism in the United States, why did I focus on portraits of activists rather than the ideas themselves?

I have been listening to Eric Marcus's [Making Gay History podcast](https://makinggayhistory.com/) and my favorite episode is the one in which he interviews the inimitable Sylvia Rivera. Sylvia Rivera's critique of assimilation within the LGBT rights movement inspired me to make a portrait series of lesser known activists, but I was depressed by the cheerful, cloying cartoon I had drawn of her. Lisa assured me these feelings are normal when manning a boothfull of your own trinkets: the highs are high and the lows are low.

I was packing up our tent when I began to feel cheered by how organized we were and all the sweeties who were interested in our cards. Wasn't it lovely to sit in the shade with Carolyn, munch on raw broccoli and try to pay the perfect amount of attention to passers by? Fall Fest was an honest day's work and its emotional cadence didn't feel much different than debugging an ambitious piece of code, although in the case of the former I lost around \$200 for my labor. At least for the time being, the gypsy festival life is not for me. It is neither leisure nor a living; it occupies an uncanny valley between creating branding and developing my own artistic sensibility. I admire my friends who make this physically demanding work their livelihood and never stop.
