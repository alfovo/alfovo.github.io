A startup that provides intelligent URLs, <a href="https://www.geni.us/">GeniusLink,</a> hired me to design and develop a web application that shows country-specific redirection information for intelligent links. I used ServiceStack, ASP.NET Core 2.0, and MongoDB on the back-end; Bootstrap4 and Vue.js on the front-end.

<div class="horizontal-content">
  <li style="margin-right: 1em;">
    <img src="/assets/img/design/lp_mobile.png" alt="Mobile design" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>The Design Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Link Explorer is a free web tool that allows marketers to examine how
      their intelligent links are behaving and routing. Genius Link is hoping
      to save their customers time when testing how intelligent links behave as
      they're being routed to various destinations around the world.

  </li>
</div>

### Key Features

- Show how an intelligent link reacts to different scenarios.
- Generate a tangible report that users can easily share.
- Create a tool that is fun to use and will become the go-to tool for marketers checking their links.
