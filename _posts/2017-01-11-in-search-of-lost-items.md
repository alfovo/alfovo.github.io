Happy New Year! My main resolution this year is to be less absent-minded and more disciplined with my time. My other goals for this year are to:

- make at least five product sales online
- sell my cards in at least one retail location
- participate in at least one local show or zinefest
- make a bangin' website

I would say my top trends at the beginning of 2017 are GeoCities websites, byzantine icons, and 1960s era kitchen color pallets. This brand new year's card is a collection of items I have lost that I would like to imagine are residing together in item heaven.
