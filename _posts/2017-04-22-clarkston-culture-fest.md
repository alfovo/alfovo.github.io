Carolyn, our neighbor Louisa and I sold our artwork at our neighborhood's summer festival, [Clarkston Culture Fest](http://www.clarkstonculturefest.org/), this weekend. I love how our booth turned out and seeing people respond to my card designs. The pen and ink succulent pattern seemed to get the most response from the crowd. One customer told me to consider attending a trade show like [Surtex](https://surtex.com/) to get my designs picked up by a distributor. I am sure that's a good tip given the cheapest booth at surtex costs \$2,700. By comparison, we paid \$50 for our booth at the Clarkston Culture Fest.
