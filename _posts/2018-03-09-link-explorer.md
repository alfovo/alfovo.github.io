A startup that provides intelligent URLs,
<a href="https://www.geni.us/">GeniusLink,</a> hired me to design and
develop a web application that shows country specific redirection
information for intelligent links. I used ServiceStack, ASP.NET Core
2.0, and MongoDB on the back-end; Bootstrap4 and Vue.js on the
front-end.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
    <img src="/assets/img/design/lp_mobile.png" alt="Mobile design" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-6 m-2">
    <h3>The Design Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Link Explorer is a free web tool that allows marketers to examine how
      their intelligent links are behaving and routing. Genius LInk is hoping
      that it will help their customers save time when testing how their
      intelligent links are behaving as they're being routed to various
      destinations around the world.
