A startup that provides intelligent URLs,
<a href="https://www.geni.us/">GeniusLink,</a> hired me to design and
develop a web application that shows country specific redirection
information for intelligent links. I used ServiceStack, ASP.NET Core
2.0, and MongoDB on the back-end; Bootstrap4 and Vue.js on the
front-end.

{% include lp_pages.html %}

#### Key Features
* Show how an intelligent link reacts in different scenarios.
* Generate a tangible report that users can easily share.
* Create a tool that is fun to use and will become the go-to tool for marketers to checking their links.
