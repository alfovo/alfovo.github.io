A pianist, vocalist and educator, Carmen is looking to expand her private teaching business to virtual students and locals of Woburn, MA. With nearly 20 years of music teaching experience and several years of special education experience, she is dedicated to providing music education that is adaptive and accessible, for everyone ðŸ’ª ðŸŽ¹! I tried to capture her funny, approachable and colorful teaching style with a bright, eye-catching illustration she could use on her [website](https://www.carmencarbonellmusic.com/) and business cards. I was inspired by the [Lite-Bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lite-Brite) toy and [Liberace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberace).

Among her students she's known for her stickers, so I designed custom kiss cut stickers she could use as business cards. I also printed two alternative designs using the glitter and holographic stickers from [stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/custom-stickers).
