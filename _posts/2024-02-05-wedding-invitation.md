My friends, [NAME REDACTED] and [NAME REDACTED] asked me to design their wedding invitations. They requested a portrait of themselves and their dog, in front of the mountain they are getting married on, surrounded by sloth and otter putti. I was only too happy to oblige. Thank you, famously reclusive business woman Lisa Frank, for producing whimsical school supplies that have inspired me for years.
