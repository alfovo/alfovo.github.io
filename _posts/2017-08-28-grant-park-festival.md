As Camelot Collective, Carolyn, Louisa, and I shared a booth at the [Grant Park Summer Shade Festival](http://www.summershadefestival.org/). This was our second festival after [Clarkston Culture Fest](http://www.clarkstonculturefest.org/), but our first large festival in Atlanta proper. I am pleased to report that, despite the stupendous booth fee, we broke even! We were even lucky enough to have a booth close to Lisa and Zach's [Calou Calay](http://caloucalay.com/). Louisa's beautiful shadow boxes paired nicely with my cards, the Camelot Collective banner I made looked great, and Carolyn's work spray painting the hanging racks a come hither customers turquoise definitely paid off. We even sold some of [Christine's](http://www.christinebaum.com/) lung print tank tops. Perhaps most exciting for me, Judith Winfrey, of the Atlanta-based meal-kit delivery service [PeachDish](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peachdish), hired me to design a postcard for PeachDish's Artist of the Month series.
