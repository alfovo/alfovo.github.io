I had a fun time playing around with CSS transforms, transitions and animations the other night. Hover over the following to check out my fancy footwork:
{% include animated-svgs1.html %}
Puts you in mind of a Geocities site from the 1990s, no?
{% include animated-svgs2.html %}
As one occasionally afflicted by cyber sickness, I don't love a ton of motion on my site. I never liked the parallax scrolling popular a few years ago, and I can be frightened by the popping open of a drawer or menu. But, I do feel nostalgic for old CSS transitions and animations of my childhood. Sometimes it feels like everything on the internet looks eerily similar as web designers scramble to keep up with the current trends. I can see why following trends is important in web design to reassure the user. An updated looking site is more likely to seem well maintained and trustworthy.
