A successful businesswoman launching her life coaching business in
Washington D.C. wants to expand her business and attract new customers.

#### Conclusions

1. Three different key value propositions for life coaching emerged from my competitive brand analysis: motivational, strategic goal setting and skills development, and therapeutic. In my interviews, users wanted someone to be accountable to while working toward their goals. If my client emphasizes motivation, accountability and strategy in service offerings, she can appeal to new customers.
2. Most people are at least casually interested in life coaching, but many mentioned being short on time and money. If my client offers a free consultation that's fast and easy to sign up for, she can turn casually interested people into return customers.

### Branding

After conducting my research, I spent the first two weeks iterating with my client on logo design and branding. We wanted her customers to feel confident, comfortable and empowered to tackle whatever challenges inspired them to seek life coaching. Also, we wanted lighthearted brand imagery to differentiate my client from the stock photos of tree lined parkways, disheveled notebooks and meditating women featured on her competitors' websites.

A bright color palette, custom svg illustrations and simple typography highlight my client's warm and empathetic approach to life coaching.

### Prototype

After settling on a brand-mark and icon set, I created a prototype for single page microsite that highlighted my client's service offerings, testimonials and included a scheduling interface. I used [Ryan Singer's shorthand](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) to design my user flow and then created mock ups in Figma and Principle.

      <img src="/assets/img/design/nk_sitemap.svg" alt="nk_availibility" />
    </object>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6 col-9 align-self-center">

      src="/assets/img/design/nk_schedule_prototype.gif"

    />
  </div>
</div>

### User Testing

Three users tested two different prototypes by moving between static
wireframe images.

> "Wait is that an angler fish? Do you know how those things reproduce?"

> "I like the interface, but I think your lightest yellow might be too
> light as a background."

> "No offense, but the animation is giving me vertigo."

#### Conclusions

1. Users were unsure of whether they would remember to confirm their appointment via email.
2. Users preferred a more clickable scheduling interface to my initial single page prototype.
3. Users liked being able to see my client's availability before submitting any information.
4. There was not enough information about my client herself. Users wanted to see more than one photograph of her.
