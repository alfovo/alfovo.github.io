A successful businesswoman launching her life coaching business in
Washington D.C. wants to expand her business and attract new customers.

### Branding

After conducting my research, I spent the first two weeks iterating with my client on logo design and branding. We wanted her customers to feel confident, comfortable and empowered to tackle whatever challenges inspired them to seek life coaching. Also, we wanted lighthearted brand imagery to differentiate my client from the stock photos of tree lined parkways, disheveled notebooks and meditating women featured on her competitors' websites.

A bright color palette, custom svg illustrations and simple typography highlight my client's warm and empathetic approach to life coaching.

### Prototype

After settling on a brand-mark and icon set, I created a prototype for single page microsite that highlighted my client's service offerings, testimonials and included a scheduling interface. I used [Ryan Singer's shorthand](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows) to design my user flow and then created mock ups in Figma and Principle.
