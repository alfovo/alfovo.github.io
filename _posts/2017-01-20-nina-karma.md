A successful businesswoman launching her life coaching business in Washington D.C. requires memorable branding and an easy way for customers to view her services, sign up for her newsletter and schedule appointments. 

### The Design Challenge
Although Nina had success finding customers through word of mouth, she wanted more visibility for her business. Furthermore, being in the relatively new life coaching space, she had some difficulty communicating the value proposition of her services to new customers.
