A successful businesswoman launching her life coaching business in Washington D.C. requires memorable branding and an easy way for customers to view her services, sign up for her newsletter and schedule appointments.

## The Design Challenge
Although Nina successfully found customers through word of mouth, she wanted more visibility for her business. Furthermore, being in the relatively new life coaching space, she had some difficulty communicating the value proposition of her services to new customers.

Another key concern for Nina was scheduling customer appointments. She had been managing all her appointments through phone or text conversations, which was making it difficult to scale her business. She wanted a faster, easier scheduling process for existing customers and a quick way for new customers to make appointments.

## Research
I began my research with two questions: 

> What kind of people need life coaching?
> What kind of brand messages do successful life coaches employ?

## Workflow

After conducting my research, I spent the first two weeks iterating with Nina on logo design and branding. We wanted her customers to feel confident, comfortable and empowered to tackle whatever challenges inspired them to seek life coaching. Also, we wanted lighthearted brand imagery to differentiate my client from the traditional images of tree lined parkways, scribbled notebooks and meditating women featured on her competitors' websites.

After settling on a brand-mark and icon set, I created a prototype for single page microsite that highlighted Nina's service offerings, testimonials and information about herself for new customers. From pen and paper, to visual comps in Figma, to high fidelity mockups using Principle, the design process continued for several iterations.

## Branding

A bright color palette, custom svg illustrations and simple typography stands out from stock photos that dominate the genre and highlight my client's warm and empathetic approach to life coaching.
