### Update from February 2017

We've added a series of cards and stickers with our houseplants on them. Succulents seem especially trendy at the moment and I am happy to jump on the bandwagon. I am pleased with how well my [first order of stickers](https://www.stickermule.com/) turned out.

### Update from March 2017

We've added another new series of cards: five portraits of lesser known women activists. Inspired by the recent presidential election, we pledged to donate half the profits from our cards to [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-involved/other-ways-give).

#### Sylvia Rivera

</div>

> “Hell hath no fury like a drag queen scorned”

Sylvia Rivera was a drag queen and civil rights activist who fought for transgender and gay rights. She fought to keep both transgender people and drag culture as a part of the broader lesbian and gay rights movement. While marching in Italy, she was dubbed “The mother of all gay people”.

#### Ella Baker

  </div>
</div>

> “Strong people don’t need strong leaders.”

A hero of the civil rights movement, Ella Baker played key roles in the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. She supported grass-roots political activism and a collectivist style of leadership. She mentored and inspired a generation of young civil rights activists.

#### Shirley Chisholm

  </div>
</div>

> “If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.”

In 1969, Shirley Chisholm was the first black woman to be elected to the US Congress, where she held seven terms. She was also the first black candidate to run for a major party’s nomination for president of the United States.

#### Billie Jean King

<div class="row">

    <img class="prototype" src="/assets/img/design/bjk_card.jpg" alt="Ella Baker A7 card"/>
  </div>
</div>

> “If you're going to make an error, make a doozy.”

Known as one of the best tennis players of all time, Billie Jean King was also a strong advocate for gender equality, and she fought for equal prize money for men and women. In her 1973 “Battle of the Sexes” match against a male former Wimbledon champion, she beat him in front of 50 million TV viewers. After King threatened to boycott the US Open, it became the first tournament to offer equal pay to men and women. She was also one of the first major athletes to come out as openly gay.

### On Printing and Methodology

Thanks to a loan from my wonderful aunt, I bought an Epson Artisan Inkjet Printer so that I could print test batches of cards with different color settings and sizes. I'm now printing my cards on Inkpress Rag Warm Tone 200gsm Inkjet paper and hand folding them on a scoring board. While the profit on these cards is minimal, I am now satisfied with the quality of the final product.

The following is our artist statement for Hodgepodge, one of the more difficult kinds of statements one can make:

> Camelot Collective consists of two artists originally from Virginia, Alex Volpert and Carolyn Ayers. When Carolyn was working on her PhD in Evolutionary Biology at Emory, she invited Alex, a burned-out software developer working in Washington D.C., to rent an extra room in her house in colorful Tucker, Georgia. Together we set up an art collective —Alex draws the portraits, often from one of Carolyn's photographs, and Carolyn digitally edits and arranges them to be printed on greeting cards, stickers, pins or notecards.

> Our intention is make cheerful portraits inspired by the plants, animals and history around us. Carolyn runs a dog photography/daycare business and our first series of work centers around the momentary passions of our favorite dogs. Our work tries to capture the personalities of her clients —their emotional range, their aspirations, their squabbles or crushes —in graphic ink portraits.

> We also made a series of bright, abstract succulent portraits. We are inspired by the challenge of depicting their hidden lives. We wanted our portraits to show the range of peaceful to frenzied energy that the contours of succulents can excite. We hope that the viewer finds our succulent collection, available both in sticker form and as a stationary set, aesthetically nourishing.

> Finally we are both very interested in lost or hidden stories and want to draw attention to the history of activism in the United States. In particular, we want to create artwork that celebrates the legacy of lesser known women activists. Our latest work is a set of cards with five portraits of women who have made significant contributions to social justice over the past century. We believe in the importance of sharing this history, especially in the current political climate, and are proud to live in a city with a rich civil rights heritage.
