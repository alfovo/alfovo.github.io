Jillian and I have been fans of [inspirobot](https://inspirobot.me/) for years. When she mentioned her desire not to have to switch tabs when inspiroboting her way though a long build, I decided to create a chrome extension for her. Voila my first chrome extension, the [Inspirobot #1 Fan Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/inspirobot-1-fan-extensio/pfnbkppejibkaadinnkcapdbeedchejp?hl=en) from the ominous sounding Volpert Industries. I wrote [the code](https://github.com/alfovo/inspirobotNum1Fan) fairly quickly, but I'm hoping to go back to it and add some features.
