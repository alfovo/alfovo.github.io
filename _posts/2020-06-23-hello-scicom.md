Carolyn and her business partner, Sarah, have started a science communication company named [Hello Scicom](https://www.hellosci.com/about)! They asked me to make their logo and after a few brainstorming sessions, we settled on an illustration of the cute and terrifying [Potoo bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potoo). 

### Early Iterations

Carolyn ran with the color scheme and created a [truly banging website](https://www.hellosci.com/). I was very proud to be named Design Czar.
