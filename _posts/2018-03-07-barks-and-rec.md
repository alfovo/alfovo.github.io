After being in the business for three years, a mom and pop dog daycare business is struggling to manage an influx of customers. To improve customer service, they want to streamline appointment scheduling, communicate their service offerings to new and existing customers and re-brand their business.

### Branding

With facilities to board up to six dogs at one time, the Barks & Rec brand sits at the intersection of affordable and boutique. I worked with the owners to create a friendly, pet-centric brandmark with accompanying svg icons that could be used on a future website.

### Prototype

The customers of Barks & Rec have different levels of technological literacy, so I prioritized making the interface simple and accessible.
