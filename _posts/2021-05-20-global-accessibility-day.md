Happy Accessibility day! Thanks to Jeanette, Khan Academy reserved an entire day for Accessibility activism this year, encouraging everyone to experiment with using a screen reader, listen to a11y lightning talks, review the Khan Academy Accessibility guide, and hack away at existing accessibility issues. To celebrate, I created a crest for the Accessibility guild, emceed the lightning talks, and created celebratory slack icons.

### Early Iterations

### Final A11y Icons

We prioritized giving the icons a stark color contrast and ensuring they were visible in light and dark modes.
