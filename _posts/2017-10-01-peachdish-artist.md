I was selected to have my work featured on a postcard as PeachDish's October [Artist of the Month](https://www.wonderroot.org/food-company-care-supporting-arts/). Not to brag too much, but I am ecstatic to have something in common with an Atlanta artist I really admire: Kyle Brooks, aka [BlackCatTips](http://www.blackcattips.com/).
