### you are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

Welcome to my piece of internet! If you're trying to find out more about me, I hope that this is where you end up. I built this site using [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and would love _any_ feedback on the code.

So help me, I'm always interested in working on a fun side project. Let me know if you have an interesting proposition. I also collect Griswold skillets manufactured in Erie, Pennsylvania. They just don't make cast-iron cookware like they used to! If you're looking to buy or sell üç≥, <a href="mailto:afvolpert@gmail.com">email</a> me.
