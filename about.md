## Nice to meet you, I'm Alex.

After years of working in software development and doing design freelance projects, I left my corporate job to do what I love: creating lovely visual experiences for people, from design to deployment. Check out my resume or send me an email if you're interested in working with me!

I am also looking for Griswold cast iron skillets. If you are looking to make the deal of a lifetime, please contact me.
