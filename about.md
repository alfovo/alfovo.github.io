## Hey there friendly stranger!

I'm Alex Volpert, and I'm a freelance Designer and Engineer. After working in the software industry for 6+ years, I've messed around in just about every part of the stack. As a freelancer I have been able to focus on what I love: creating delightful visual experiences for people, from design to deployment. My passion is building user interfaces, and I'm hoping to learn and grow from a team of experienced, creative designers and engineers. Check out my [resume](/assets/img/alexandra_volpert_resume.pdf "my resume") if you're interested in working with me!

I also collect Griswold skillets manufactured in Erie, Pennsylvania. They just don't make cast-iron cookware like they used to! If you're looking to buy or sell 🍳, shoot me an <a href="mailto:afvolpert@gmail.com">email.</a>
