## Welcome to my piece of internet!

If you're trying to find out more about me, I hope that this is where you end up. I built this site using [jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/). Peep my code [here](https://github.com/alfovo/alfovo.github.io).

I also collect Griswold skillets manufactured in Erie, Pennsylvania. They just don't make cast-iron cookware like they used to! If you're looking to buy or sell 🍳, please <a href="mailto:afvolpert@gmail.com">email</a> me.
