    <h3>The Design Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      Having found customers mostly by word of mouth, my client wanted a way to
      easily communicate the value proposition of her services to new customers.
      She was also managing all her appointments through phone or text
      conversations and wanted an easy way for customers to see her availability
      and make appointments.

      I began my research with the question:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p>What do people think of when they think of life coaching?</p>

    <h4>Competitive Brand Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      Reading the profiles on
      <a href="https://www.expertise.com/dc/washington/life-coaches"
        >Expertise</a
      >
      of the top 12 life coaches in the D.C. metro area, I observed three
      different value propositions for life coaching: motivational, strategic
      goal setting and skills development, and as an accountability source. In a
      more general sense, these life coaches help their clients tackle
      overwhelming goals. My client's potential customer base includes anyone
      who is experiencing a disconnect between the life they would like and the
      life they currently have.

    <h4>Directed User Interviews</h4>
    <p>
      I surveyed 9 people from age 26 to 65 to understand their perceptions of
      and interest in life coaching. I also asked them what would help them
      acheieve their goals.

    <h5>Pain Points</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Skeptical of value: "Why should I see a life coach if I am already
          seeing a psychologist?"
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Concerned about cost: "It seems like a lot of money up front to work
          with someone who might not even be a good fit for my personality or
          problems."

      <li>
        <p>
          Short on time: "I wouldn't even know where to start catching someone
          up on my problems-- there is a big time investment."
