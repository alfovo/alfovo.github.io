			<h4>Competitive Brand Analysis</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>Using the profiles on <a href="https://www.expertise.com/dc/washington/life-coaches">Expertise</a> of the top 12 life coaches in the D.C. metro area, I made a word map of the 56 most common words. I removed the words coach, coaching, counseling, life, clients, area, individuals, provides, professional, experience, services, client, common words and any proper nouns to produce more meaningful results.</p>
			<p>I sorted the words from the word map into categories representing three separate value propositions:</p>

	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3 explainer-text">
		  	<ul>
			  	<li><p><b>Therapeutic: </b>holistic, purpose, wellness, compassionate, healing, living, fulfilling, dedicated</p></li>
			  	<li><p><b>Motivational: </b>progress-inhibiting, obstacles, overcome, empowering, forward, challenges, achieve</p></li>
			  	<li><p><b>Strategic: </b>effective, strategies, strategy, tools, goals, purposeful, habits, learn</p></li>
			</ul>

		<div class="col-lg-10">
			<p>When reading the profiles, I noticed similar areas of emphasis. Coaches like Barbara Herzog and Jim Weinstein seem to lean heavily on their skill as motivational speakers. Other brands like Carey Coaching and Catherine Ecton Life Coaching emphasize their experience in strategic planning and development. Still others are featured in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/life-coaching/dc/washington">Psychology Today</a> as licensed therapists equipped to deal with trauma or deficient self-esteem.

			<h4>Key Insights</h4>
	  		<hr>
			<ol>
				<p><li>Three different key value propositions for life coaching emerged from my competitive brand analysis: motivational, strategic goal setting and skills development, and therapeutic.</li></p>
				<p><li>Most people are at least casually interested in life coaching. Nina's potential customer base includes anyone who is experiencing a disconnect between the life they would like and the life they currently have.</li></p>
				<p><li>By emphasizing her three value propositions, Nina can appeal to everyone in her customer base. Also by offering a free consultation that's easy to sign up for, she can turn casually interested people into return customers.</li></p>
